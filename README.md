This package provides a interface to fetch the parsed JSON files of parsed match replays of a specific player using the OpenDota API from <https://www.opendota.com/>. 
The package also provides tools to extract data, such as last hit/deny, from the parsed JSON files and convert the extract data into a tidy dataframe.
